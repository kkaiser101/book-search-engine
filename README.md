## Description

The purpose of this project was to get hands on experience using Apollo Server and MERN stack. This was by far one of the most challenging projects I have taken on, and it is currently not in a functional state. However, I did gain valuable experience that I am going to use moving forward. 

## Installation

- Ensure that all necessary npm packages are installed when running from the command line!
